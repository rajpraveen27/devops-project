Project Overview:
 The Personal Portfolio Website is a responsive and professional web application designed to showcase my academic background, technical skills, projects, certifications, and achievements. The website serves as a digital resume that allows recruiters and professionals to easily explore my profile, view my projects, and connect with me through GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.
 The project demonstrates practical implementation of front-end web development concepts and version control using Git and GitHub. The portfolio is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible online.

Objectives:
To create a professional online presence as a B.Tech Computer Science student
To showcase technical skills, projects, and certifications
To practice real-world Git and GitHub workflow
To deploy a live static website using GitHub Pages

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – Structure of the website
CSS3 – Styling and responsive layout
Git – Version control system
GitHub – Code hosting and collaboration
GitHub Pages – Website deployment

Project Features:
Clean and professional UI design
Responsive layout for different screen sizes
Dedicated sections for About, Skills, Projects, Training, Certifications, Achievements, and Education
Clickable links to GitHub repositories and LinkedIn profile
Hosted online using GitHub Pages

Commands Used (Git & Deployment):
  Create project and initialize Git
  mkdir my-portfolio
  cd my-portfolio
  git init

Add files and commit:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial portfolio website"

Connect to GitHub and push:
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/rajpraveen27/my-portfolio.git

Deploy using GitHub Pages:
Repository → Settings → Pages
Select main branch → /root
Save and access live URL

Challenges Faced:
1️.Git and GitHub Conflicts:
Faced non-fast-forward and unrelated history errors during push
Resolved by pulling remote changes and synchronizing branches

2️.Branch Confusion:
Initial confusion between master and main branch
Fixed by standardizing to the main branch

3️.Deployment Issues:
Website not visible initially due to incorrect GitHub Pages configuration
Solved by selecting the correct branch and root folder

4️.Design Consistency:
Maintaining a professional layout with plain CSS
Improved spacing, typography, and color consistency

Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience with Git and GitHub workflows
Better understanding of static website deployment
Improved front-end design skills
Learned to debug Git errors and resolve merge conflicts
Gained confidence in presenting projects professionally

Future Enhancements:
Make the portfolio fully responsive using advanced CSS or Tailwind
Add animations and transitions
Integrate a downloadable resume button
Convert the project into a React-based portfolio
Add backend contact form functionality

Conclusion:
The Personal Portfolio Website project successfully demonstrates my ability to design, develop, version-control, and deploy a professional web application. It reflects my technical skills, problem-solving ability, and understanding of real-world development workflows. This project plays an important role in presenting my profile to recruiters and serves as a foundation for more advanced web development projects.
